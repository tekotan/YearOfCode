    <h1>Mar 7.</h1>

    <p>A simple program. I got the idea from a friend when we were video chatting. You can visit his website at http://bit.do/100Project. He is only a beginner coder, so don't judge him. His programs might not be as amazing as mine. This program has a function that gets a random color and changes the background to that color.</p>
