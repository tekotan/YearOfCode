    <h1>Mar 8.</h1>

    <p>This was a program, that I made using canvas. I was inspired by my friend. His was a very basic version. I improved it, using if commands, and cleaner code. The squares are drawn on your screen lower and to the left/right of the previous rectangle, when the animation is done, it looks pretty cool.</p>
