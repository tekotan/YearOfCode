    <h1>Mar 11.</h1>

    <p>It has been a month. Oh, how time flies. I only have 11 months left of this challenge. That's just around 325 more projects. I'm going to run out of ideas. For this website, you have to guess a number from 0 to 100, it will tell you how close or far you were to the right number.</p>
