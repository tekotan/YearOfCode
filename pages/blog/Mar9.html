    <h1>Mar 9.</h1>

    <p>Have you ever, been playing a board game and you couldn't find the dice? You didn't want to go to the store. Now you don't you can use this program. This website, gets a random number from 1 to 6 and that's the number on the dice. It was a fairly simple program and took me around 5 minutes to make. Enjoy!</p>
