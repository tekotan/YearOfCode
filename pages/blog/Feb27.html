    <h1>Feb 27.</h1>

    <p>Ever, been arguing with your friend, about something, and to settle on who is right. You want to play rock, paper, scissors but your friend doesn't know how. Want to flip a coin, but don't have one. Now you can settle your arguement, with this coin flipper. There is a 50 | 50 chance for either possibility. </p>
