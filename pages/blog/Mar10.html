    <h1>Mar 10.</h1>

    <p>A more accurate clock than the clock in the bottom right corner of your screen. It has <strong>seconds</strong>! This clock was fairly simple, to make, I had to access the minutes seconds hours and days from the computer, using JavaScript. From, there on, it was just a matter of displaying the info in a creative way. If you want tutorials just drop me an email. </p>
