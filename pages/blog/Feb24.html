    <p>More buttons! At the end of this I might make a button compilation of all the buttons I have ever made. Speaking of compilations, check out the compilation of websites my friend has. Go to main180.tk, to see his latest creations. This button was fairly simple, i set the background to none, and when it got hovered I gave it a background of blue.</a></p>
