    <h1>Mar 17.</h1>

    <p>This is a ball that bounces from the left to the right. Even though technically a bouncy ball should go top to bottom. This website just multiplies how far the ball is moving by -1, each time it reaches the edge of each screen. Wacth out for tomorrow's site Gravity.</p>
