    <p>Gravity, the most impressive website in my opinion that I have made so far. It is a bouncy ball that is affected by gravity. Each time that the ball hits the bottom of the screen, the height it bounces, will be subtracted by 23. In the end, the site took me around 30 minutes to make, this is the longest project so far.</p>
