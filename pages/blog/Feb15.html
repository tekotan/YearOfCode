    <h1>Feb 15.</h1>

    <p>This project, took a lot of time and effort. I was trying to make a slideshow, for the past few hours, but I couldn't make it perfect. Finaly, I did. After, <strong>hours</strong>, I finally made it. Moral, of the story: If you fail, try try again. This projects itself, is fairly simple. I used jQuery, to loop through images, and show them one at a time.</p>
